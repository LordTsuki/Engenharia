# Overview
The "Liquid Galaxy Bootcamp" was created by ex-internships from the "Google Summer of Code" program. It uses concepts of the Liquid Galaxy system in order to help students learn about bash, networks, security, git, etc.

The Bootcamp was designed with two goals in mind. Introducing students to the open source world and open source communities, along with helping them learn core UNIX concepts related to the Liquid Galaxy.

# Before Start

The course is designed to start at any point but we strongly suggest to start for the first milestone (MS).
Before start, you should Fork the respository and then clone it in your own machine.

A fork is a copy of a repository where you can make all changes you want without interfering to the original content and later on you can decide to share, or not, those changes.
In GitLab, fork is easy as it gets.

1. Press the **Fork** button on the right top side

2. Select the desired **namespace**

Inside every folder you will find a .csv file which contains the issues with all the activities to be solved in each MS. This .csv file should be imported into the Gitlab issues tab.

Also we have some basic resources that can be important during the milestones:

- [Git](https://gitlab.com/liquid-galaxy/lg-bootcamp/-/wikis/Git)

# Project Overview
The bootcamp has been structured in different modules or milestones, on which the students will test multiple techniques and learn different capabilities.  

### [MS1 - System Basic Commands](https://gitlab.com/liquid-galaxy/lg-bootcamp/-/wikis/MS1-UNIX-basic-commands)
In this Milestone, your first actions will be focused on understanding basic UNIX commands to perform basic actions that we do via GUI. Bash is the focus of this module and you will learn how to manage with basics concepts like using parameters, conditionals and iterative structures.

### [MS2 - Network Protocols](https://gitlab.com/liquid-galaxy/lg-bootcamp/-/wikis/MS2-SSH-communication-setup)
Students will learn Secure Shell (ssh) and Secure Copy Protocol (scp), tools that can be used to access from a local host to a remote host, between remote host and also transfer files between them.

### [MS3 - UNIX + LG] - *Under Development*
After the completition of MS1 the students will update their scripts to fit into the Liquid Galaxy cluster using the knowledge adquired in MS2.

### [MS4 Liquid Galaxy (Part1)] - *Under Development*
The Liquid Galaxy is a cluster of computers in an isolated network that runs severals programs, one of them Google Earth. On this milestone you will learn how to interact with this program.

### [MS5 Liquid Galaxy (Part2)] - *Under Development*
Several projects have been developed since the creation of the Liquid Galaxy ORG. Here you will learn to install and deploy other projects.

### [MS6 Network scripting] - *Under Development*
In this final module you will mix different scripts created in the others milestones to accomplish more complex operations.
